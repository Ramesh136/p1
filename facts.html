            <strong>CHALLENGES FACED BY THE DOCTORS AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS</strong><br> violence against doctors and other medical personnel has increased over the past few decades, with up to 75% doctors facing this during their practice in India.8 Doctors attribute the surge in violence against healthcare workers to a mix of ignorance and fear, which is amplified by the pandemic.9 The lockdown has exacerbated the problem, with patients unable to access healthcare due to transport suspension, fear of law enforcement and frustration following quarantine or containment zone restrictions. The types of attacks have ranged from verbal abuse, verbal threats or aggressive gestures in majority of cases.10 However, there have also been serious reports of manhandling, abduction and murder.8

           <strong>Doctors, Health-care Workers and Fight against COVID-19</strong><br> Needless to say, doctors, nurses and people working in health-care sectors are particularly vulnerable to the highly infectious disease. In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges. The list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors, nurses, medical cleaners, pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators. In the fight against coronavirus, the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and ventilators as their weapons. Not to forget, medical researchers are working day in and night out against all odds, hoping to find the antidote to the disease

            <strong>Impact of COVID-19 on doctors and healthcare providers during the pandemic in Sudan</strong><br>
            The health system in Sudan was barely managing the day-to-day cases presenting to hospitals. Under these unusual circumstances, the heavy load of patients now presenting to this fragile system in relation to the available services, resources and staff has led to a total a loss of flow within these facilities and the overcrowding of rooms, contributing to the nosocomial spread to hospital staff, uninfected patients, patients presenting with other health concerns and family members.
