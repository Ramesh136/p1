            <strong>CHALLENGES FACED BY THE DOCTORS AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS</strong><br> violence against doctors and other medical personnel has increased over the past few decades, with up to 75% doctors facing this during their practice in India.8 Doctors attribute the surge in violence against healthcare workers to a mix of ignorance and fear, which is amplified by the pandemic.9 The lockdown has exacerbated the problem, with patients unable to access healthcare due to transport suspension, fear of law enforcement and frustration following quarantine or containment zone restrictions. The types of attacks have ranged from verbal abuse, verbal threats or aggressive gestures in majority of cases.10 However, there have also been serious reports of manhandling, abduction and murder.8
