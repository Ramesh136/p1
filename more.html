                    <article>Epidemiologist and public health specialist . He was born on Sept 26, 1947, in a village in Yemen's Taiz governorate, and died on June 16, 2020, in Sana'a, Yemen, aged 72 years. <br>
                        Yassin Abdel-Warith was involved in the response to major disease outbreaks across Yemen for nearly 50 years. It was no surprise, then, that WHO brought him in as a consultant to help when COVID-19 emerged in Yemen. Despite the ongoing conflict in the country, Abdel-Warith immediately got to work organising surveillance teams and setting up isolation centres.

                    <article>Pulmonologist and former head of the Department of Medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Science. Born on June 14, 1941, in Shikohabad, India, he died on May 23, 2020, in New Delhi, India, aged 78 years. <br> Although he was a legendary pulmonologist, called upon to treat presidents and Bollywood stars, Jitendra Nath Pande made time for everyone. His office door was open to colleagues, students, and, especially, patients. “He gave a lot of time to patients”, said Abhishek Bhartia, the Director of the Sitaram Bhartia Institute of Science and Research in New Delhi, India, where Pande worked later in his career. “He was meticulous and he would never rush patients.” Instead, Pande used to frequently remind his students that patients were their best teachers.

                        Arpik Asratyan joined the Department of Epidemiology and Modern Vaccination Technologies at what is now I M Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University at a crucial moment in 1997. An expert in viral hepatitis, her arrival coincided with “a period at the turn of the century when the problem of parenteral viral hepatitis was especially urgent both in Russia and in the world”, said her colleague Elena Gennadievna Simonova, a Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Modern Vaccination Technologies. “Professor Asratyan was an extremely popular scientist and teacher who extensively trained scientific personnel. She was instrumental in the prevention of viral hepatitis”, said Simonova.

                        There is a tradition at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Valladolid in Spain that when medical students reach the end of their studies they celebrate a last dinner with their professors. Although she had a leg injury as her class's event approached in 2015, Sara Bravo Lopez was determined to take part in the celebration. “She kept dancing all night, happy, because we were finally doctors”, said her classmate Luis Cabezudo Molleda, an internal medicine resident at the Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Palencia

                        Claudia Nogueira Cardoso always made sure to keep extra medical supplies in her car or her bag. As she travelled around Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where she lived, she offered help to people in the community. “She was very charitable, a friend and companion who always had a friendly word”, her brother Claumyr Cardoso said. “She must be remembered as a person who liked to help everyone.”

                    <article>Former Director of Epidemiology of the Institute of Public Health, Bolivar state, Venezuela. She was born on Sept 9, 1953, in Puerto de Hierro, Venezuela, and died on July 25, 2020, in Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela, aged 66 years. <br>
                        Livia Carrion studied medicine at the Universidad de Oriente in Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela, a school with the motto, “From the town we come and to the town we go”. She would go on to dedicate her career to providing medical services to neglected communities, often in far-flung locations. “Her sublime love and dedication to medicine and to helping the needy encouraged her to study and to work for 35 years in public health, never practising private medicine”, said her daughter Katherine Sulbaran.

                        Nino Cassanello Layana taught his medical students what he called the “principle of responsibility”. He believed that students needed to get to know their patients on a personal level and he encouraged them to ask about “not just the medical problems, but what kind of job he does, where he lived, what about his family”, said Cristobal Sanchez Metz, an adult hospitalist specialising in internal medicine in Washington, USA, who studied under Cassanello for 3 years. Cassanello taught at three different medical schools in Guayaquil, Ecuador—the University of Guayaquil, Universidad Catolica de Santiago de Guayaquil, and Universidad de Especialidades Espiritu Santo—and instructed thousands of students over his career, focusing primarily on internal medicine and medical semiology.

                        As a young doctor working in Sudan, Adil El Tayar became aware of the rising problem of kidney diseases, particularly among young people. Without access to transplant surgery, patients were dependent on regular dialysis, which disrupted their ability to work or study. His mission was to replace the country's largely privatised, fragmented transplant services with a centralised registry and practice. “He wanted to build this service that could breed excellence, whether in diagnostics or on the operative or medical sides”, said his cousin, Hisham El-Khidir, a surgeon working at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in the UK.

                        Salvacion Rodriguez Gatchalian, better known as Sally, knew how to disarm people. It was a skill that served her well as a paediatrician, but was even more crucial in the leadership roles she took on, including serving as President of the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society of the Philippines from 2014 to 2016 and of the Philippine Pediatric Society, beginning in 2018. “She was whip smart and a really great consensus builder”, said Edsel Salvana, the Director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the National Institutes of Health at the University of the Philippines (UP) Manila. “She was a great listener, but she was never afraid to speak up on controversial issues, even if it wasn't very popular.”

                        Mustafa Kamal was in the midst of transforming Nishtar Medical University when he died of COVID-19. Named the first Vice-Chancellor when the university was elevated from a college in 2017, he was working to introduce new programmes at the institution and overseeing the construction of a new 500-bed hospital. “He was very enthusiastic to really improve the medical education and health care in that part of the world”, said Ghulam Qadir, a graduate of Nishtar and now an addiction psychiatry specialist, who is the CEO of Apex Behavioral Health in Dearborn, MI, USA. Qadir started working with Kamal a year ago to improve the psychiatric training at the university. “You would never find another person like him. If he promised something, he delivered.”
